# What is Rezible?
Rezible is an open-source platform aiming to reduce the burden on oncall teams by streamlining operational 
processes, while also collecting and visualising data on overall oncall health.

## Motivation
Despite being a critical role in keeping live software products running, oncall is often overlooked as a 
secondary job function. The stress, fatigue, and compromised output resulting from subpar oncall 
is viewed as unavoidable by many teams.

We believe that with the right practices in place, many of the negative aspects of being oncall can be improved or removed -  
so Rezible aims to provide those practices to teams as an "Oncall on Rails" experience.

## Current Status
Rezible is currently under heavy development, with no stable release available.
In the meantime please feel free to leave feedback, requests, or suggestions in the form of GitHub Issues!
