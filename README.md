# What is Rezible?
Rezible is an open-source platform aiming to reduce the burden on oncall teams by streamlining operational 
processes, while also collecting and visualising data on overall oncall health.

## Features
- 🔗 Easily integrates with the tools you already use
- 📋 Oncall shift event annotations & automated handovers
  - 🔎 Flag unhelpful alerts, 'invisible' toil work, and more
- 🗣️ AI-powered post-incident debriefs & incident retrospectives with realtime collaboration
- 📚 Searchable & discoverable knowledgebase, auto-populated from retrospectives
- 🎓 Structured oncall training & onboarding
- 🗓️ Scheduling & facilitation of cross-team meetings (e.g. incident review, operations review)
- ☑️ Team oncall backlog task tracking
- 📊 Data collection & visualisation - start reporting on your oncall health!

## Motivation
Despite being a critical role in keeping live software products running, oncall is often overlooked as a 
secondary job function. The stress, fatigue, and compromised output resulting from subpar oncall 
is viewed as unavoidable by many teams.

We believe that with the right tooling, many of the negative aspects of being oncall can be improved or removed -  
so Rezible aims to be that "Oncall on Rails".

## Current Status
Rezible is currently under heavy development, with no stable release available.
In the meantime please feel free to leave feedback, requests, or suggestions in the form of GitHub Issues!
