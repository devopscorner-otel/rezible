# What is Rezible?
Rezible is an open-source platform that streamlines & automates everyday operational tasks for oncall teams, 
while collecting data and reporting on overall operational health. Think of it as "Oncall on Rails", helping
teams worry less about the state of their oncall rosters!

> [!NOTE]  
> Rezible is currently **under heavy development**.

## Motivation
Despite being a critical role in keeping live software products running, oncall is often overlooked as a 
secondary job function. The stress, fatigue, and compromised output resulting from subpar oncall 
is viewed as unavoidable by many teams.

We believe that with the right practices in place, many of the negative aspects of being oncall can be improved or removed -  
so Rezible aims to provide those practices to teams as an "Oncall on Rails" experience.

## Current Status
Rezible is currently under heavy development, with no stable release available.
In the meantime please feel free to leave feedback, requests, or suggestions in the form of GitHub Issues!
